            On the true pursuit of learning, it was only natural to turn this pursuit towards the realm of technology. Creativity and innovation are my zeal of life. I thrive in environments that require individuals to seek an increase of knowledge and compound on their abilities to learn. My previous fields in science and animation elborate my want to incorporate all corners of learning into a cohessive expression.

            My love for technology had begun as early as five with my first Windows computer. I would spend much of my time attempting to comprehend how to install games, explore encyclopedias, and eventually be allowed the opportunity to be loosed on the World Wide Web. During childhood my inquisitiveness took over and I had gained the ability to reboot computers, tear apart the phone leading it once again being operational, and ultimately become the "technology savy" ten year old in the house. My highschool years were filled with optimizing my web browsing skills. It is here that insight to research became my primary focus. This lasted throughout my college years with an emphasis on learning new software. Eventually, I entered into the Master's program at Savannah College of Art and Design in the field of animation. This was the true testing grounds to the amount of software I would need to know and the most exposed to technology I ever had.

            It wasn't until last year did I eventually become introduced to the field of engineering. I have always enjoyed numbers, but was not a pure mathmatician as I enjoyed numbers for purpose. I was encouraged to continue growing and understanding, which lead to my attending Georgia Tech bootcamp for coding, where I can incorporate a mathematical, scientific, and artistic mind into one single field.
